# What is ABOD3?
ABODE is an integrated development environment (IDE) for Behavior Oriented Design (BOD). ABOD3 is the latest iteration of the ABODE, providing new functionalities such as our novel approach to AI-debugging.

Unlike previous updates of ABODE, it was built from scratch, without any usage of the existing source code. In addition to new functionalities, the new version aims at using modular, clean-code, with all the features and performance enhancements of Java 8. The GUI framework used, JavaFX, gives the new version a clean, modern look, while maintaining cross-platform compatibility.
