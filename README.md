# What is ABOD3?
ABODE is an integrated development environment (IDE) for Behavior Oriented Design (BOD). ABOD3 is the latest iteration of the ABODE, providing new functionalities such as our novel approach to AI-debugging.

Unlike previous updates of ABODE, it was built from scratch, without any usage of the existing source code. In addition to new functionalities, the new version aims at using modular, clean-code, with all the features and performance enhancements of Java 8. The GUI framework used, JavaFX, gives the new version a clean, modern look, while maintaining cross-platform compatibility.

# Where can I get it from?
ABOD3 is currently available on this GitHub. An installation guide is available [here](https://github.com/RecklessCoding/ABOD3/wiki/Installation-Instructions) and precompiled JARs of various versions are available [here](https://github.com/RecklessCoding/ABOD3/tree/master/Pre-compiled%20Jars).

# Who are the developers?
The lead developer is [Andreas Theodorou](http://recklesscoding.com/), who at time of writing is a PhD student at the [University of Bath](http://bath.ac.uk/).

Alexandros Rotsidi, an EngD student at the University of Bath, is working towards porting ABOD3 to Android phones.

[Robbert (Rob) R. Wortham](http://robwortham.com/) and [Joanna J. Bryson](http://www.cs.bath.ac.uk/~jjb/) from University of Bath contributed by helping with the design and testing of the final deliverable. Rob is the developer of [Instinct, a  transparent planner](http://www.robwortham.com/instinct-planner/). His GitHub can be found [here](https://github.com/rwortham).

We are always happy to accept contributions and feedback by third party users! Get in touch via [Twitter](@recklesscoding) or GitHub, if interested.
